Date: 1/25/26 - Subject: Setting up Github
In my old university we used github alot however we used it differently. 
We never set up a SSH key or anything like that but we did use command line for it.
Actually I eventually learned to use github desktop which I personally thought was easier to use.
I was able to set up my local and team repositories and things seem to be working but truthfully 
I have never used WSL so I'm not completly sure I set things correctly but things do seem to be working.
