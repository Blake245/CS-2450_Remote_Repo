Date: 1/25/26 - Subject: Setting up Github
In my old university we used github alot however we used it differently. 
We never set up a SSH key or anything like that but we did use command line for it.
Actually I eventually learned to use github desktop which I personally thought was easier to use.
I was able to set up my local and team repositories and things seem to be working but truthfully 
I have never used WSL so I'm not completly sure I set things correctly but things do seem to be working.

This happened last week but I forgot to write, anyway our group decided to do an mental health social media app for our project.
Our plan is to make it a place where people can anonymously chat with other people talking about mental health issues,
helping other people, or just talking with other people though the focus is on mental health. We made some requirements and
user stories but I don't think we've completly narrowed down what will be included. I think it will be an interesting project.

This week was focusing mainly on our pitch your project presentation where we give a presentation on what are project are.
Tuesday we had a lecture on how to make our presentations look good and about the assignment. On Thursday we spent pretty much
all class working on the presentation. We decided to give everybody their own slide to work on and I chose to do the In-scope and Out-of-Scope
features. I'm almost done with it I got the text I just need to add some pictures and polish it a bit which I'll do on Sunday.
